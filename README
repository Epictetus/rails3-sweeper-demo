## Powered by Rails 3.0.9 and [Dilla](https://github.com/mperham/dalli)

Provides a simple demonstration of action caching with memcached using the dilla gem.
The demo contains two models, user has many widgets which belong to user (0..N relationship).
This also has the benefit of demonstrating a simple nested route for those new to rails.
Widgets can only be accessed via a user with the user show view being cached with some widget data.
